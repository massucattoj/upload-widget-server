A modern and efficient file upload server built with TypeScript, Fastify, and AWS S3 integration. This project provides a robust API for handling file uploads with features like CSV processing, type safety with Zod, and comprehensive testing.

## üöÄ Features

- **Type-Safe API**: Built with TypeScript and Zod for complete type safety
- **Fast Server**: Powered by Fastify framework
- **Database Integration**: Uses DrizzleORM with PostgreSQL
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 integration for reliable file storage
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI integration
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with Vitest
- **Development Tools**: Biome for linting and formatting
- **Docker Support**: Easy development setup with Docker Compose

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: Fastify
- **ORM**: DrizzleORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- pnpm package manager
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local development)
- AWS account with S3 access (for production)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd upload-widget-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start the database**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Run database migrations**
   ```bash
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run tests once
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch
```

## üìö Database Management

```bash
# Generate migration files
pnpm db:generate

# Apply migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Open Drizzle Studio
pnpm db:studio
```

## üèóÔ∏è Build

To build the project for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## üìù API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the Swagger documentation at:
- `/documentation` - Swagger UI
- `/documentation/json` - OpenAPI JSON specification

## üê≥ Docker Support

The project includes Docker support for easy development and deployment:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Development Guidelines

- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation for significant changes
- Follow the code style enforced by Biome
- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or fix


## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

The project follows several well-established architectural patterns and principles:

### Clean Architecture

The codebase is organized following Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **`src/app/`**: Application/Domain Layer
  - Contains business logic and use cases
  - Pure TypeScript implementation, framework-agnostic
  - Houses domain entities and business rules

- **`src/infra/`**: Infrastructure Layer
  - `http/`: HTTP server implementation (Fastify)
  - `db/`: Database implementations (DrizzleORM)
  - `storage/`: File storage implementations (AWS S3)
  - Handles external integrations and technical implementations

- **`src/shared/`**: Shared Utilities
  - Common utilities and helpers
  - Shared types and interfaces
  - Cross-cutting concerns

### Design Patterns

1. **Dependency Injection**
   - Loose coupling between components
   - Improved testability and maintainability
   - Dependencies are explicitly declared

2. **Repository Pattern**
   - Abstraction over data storage
   - Clean separation between business logic and data access
   - Easily swappable implementations (e.g., different storage providers)

3. **Factory Pattern**
   - Used for creating complex objects
   - Encapsulates initialization logic
   - Promotes consistency in object creation

4. **Middleware Pattern**
   - HTTP middleware for cross-cutting concerns
   - Request/Response pipeline processing
   - Authentication, logging, error handling
